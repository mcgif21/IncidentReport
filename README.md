<h2>Description</h2>
In this portfolio project I have demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework, along with the ability to communicate concisely and effectively, and a technical
understanding of a specific instance of a DDoS attack (in this case, an ICMP flood attack). The
scenario was presented by Googleâ€™s Cybersecurity Certificate program but all information within
the framework table was written by me.
